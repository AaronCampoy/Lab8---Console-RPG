Lab 08 - Create a Console Based RPG

Based off of tutorial series by BotableCoder -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgqCic2ERiM&list=PLoAoZw952_FQnNB0BMCTD5YJyFKMT13RQ

Features character creation, allowing players to enter their character's name, choose from 5 races with distinct stats, and enter their character's sex.

Players make the choice to advance along the path and risk facing monsters, or to set up and camp and relax to regain health.

Defeating monsters grants XP, and after enough is collected, the player will level up, increasing their health and damage output.

The game ends when the players health is reduced to 0.
